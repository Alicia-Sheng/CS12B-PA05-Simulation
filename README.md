# CS12b-PA05-Simulation
Members: Alicia Sheng, Phoebe Xu, Emma Xu
\nWe did a simulation of a simplified society with virus and people.
There were basically three types of people including people who always stay at home, stay at home if sick, and move every step. Our group added people who move only once seven days, and young people with greater immunity.
